# 3)"<YourName>Version4" IS DESIGNATED AS R'S WORKING
# DIRECTORY. IF NECESSARY, MANUALLY SET THE WORKING

# 4) A COPY OF ACS2018Extract.csv IS SAVED IN THE Data SUBFOLDER OF "<YourName>Version4".

# This script:
# -reads the 2018 ACS data extract into a data frame
# -creates a table of group means of income by race and sex
# -saves the table in a .csv file, and stores it in the # "Output" folder.
# -generates a bar graph showing group means of income by # race and sex
# -saves the bar graph in a .png file, and stores it in the # "Output" folder

# Clear the environment
