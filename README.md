# UKRN Virtual Workshop 2024

Click on either of the two Binder logos below.
The first one (Main) links to a virtual container with a Jupyter notebook environment.
The second one (Rstudio) links to a virtual container with an RStudio environment.

In both cases, you will see a window with a file directory containing this README document and a folder labeled "v4".
The v4 folder contains the exercise materials for this session.
