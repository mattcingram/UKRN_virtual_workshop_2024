# UKRN Virtual Workshop 2024

Click on either of the two Binder logos below.

- Main: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mattcingram/UKRN_virtual_workshop_2024/main) (this links to a virtual container with a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook environment)

- Rstudio: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mattcingram/UKRN_virtual_workshop_2024/main?urlpath=rstudio) (this links to a virtual container with an [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) environment)

In either case, you will see a window with a file directory containing this README document and a folder labeled "v4".  
The v4 folder contains the exercise materials for this session.  

This folder is the __working directory__ for the project/session. Please see notes at the beginning of the command file for comments about setting the working directory if you were working on your own computer.
This is a virtual environment, so there is no need to create a new folder for your working directory. You just need to tell R which folder to use as the working directory.

To begin, go to v4 folder, open "scripts" subfolder, and open R script there. Code will set "v4" as working directory, and users can go from there.  

__Note__: if plots do not show in RStudio window, graphs can still be saved to file and opened.
