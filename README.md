# UKRN Virtual Workshop 2024

Click on either of the two Binder logos below.

Main: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mattcingram/UKRN_virtual_workshop_2024/main)

Rstudio: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mattcingram/UKRN_virtual_workshop_2024/main?urlpath=rstudio)

The first one ("Main") links to a virtual container with a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook environment.  
The second one ("Rstudio") links to a virtual container with an [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) environment.

In both cases, you will see a window with a file directory containing this README document and a folder labeled "v4".  
The v4 folder contains the exercise materials for this session.  

To read more about containers and how Binder works with Docker images and [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) servers, see [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org).
