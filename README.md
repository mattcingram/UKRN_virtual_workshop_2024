# UKRN Virtual Workshop 2024

Click on either of the two Binder logos below.

- Main: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mattcingram/UKRN_virtual_workshop_2024/main) (this links to a virtual container with a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook environment)

- Rstudio: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mattcingram/UKRN_virtual_workshop_2024/main?urlpath=rstudio) (this links to a virtual container with an [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) environment)

In either case, you will see a window with a file directory containing this README document and a folder labeled "v4".  
The v4 folder contains the exercise materials for this session.  

This folder is the __working directory__ for the project/session. Please see notes at the beginning of the command file for comments about setting the working directory if you were working on your own computer.
This is a virtual environment, so there is no need to create a new folder for your working directory. You just need to tell R which folder to use as the working directory.

To begin, go to v4 folder, open "scripts" subfolder, and open R script there. Code will set "v4" as working directory, and users can go from there.  

__Note__: if get error that version of graphics driver does not work with current version of R, try using older version of R. If for any reason graphs do not show in plot window of RStudio, graphs can still be saved to file and opened.
  
To read more about how Binder works, see [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org). Binder combines Docker containers and a JupyterHub server; to read more about containers with Docker, see [Docker](https://docker.com/). To read more about the Jupyter project, JupyterHub, and Jupyter notebooks, see [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

Acknowledgments: These materials were created as part of a collaboration with Richard Ball and Norm Medeiros of [Project TIER](https://www.projecttier.org/), based at Haverford College. I am also grateful for feedback from participants at the March 2024 UKRN/TIER workshop, especially Clement Lee of Newcastle University.
